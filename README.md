## 🔒 Jasmine's Private Profile System - Complete Guide

### What Are Private Profiles?
Private profiles are completely isolated browsing environments within Jasmine. Each private profile operates as if it's a separate browser with its own:

- **Cookies and login sessions**
- **Browsing history and cache**
- **Saved passwords and form data**
- **Local storage and website preferences**
- **Download history and settings**

When you use a private profile, that website cannot see or access any data from other tabs, other profiles, or your shared browsing. It's like having multiple browsers running simultaneously, each completely unaware of the others.

### The Two Modes of Private Profiles

#### 1. Incognito Mode (Private Profile Without Saving)
When you launch a website with "Use Private Profile" checked but don't save it as a session:

- ✅ Creates a temporary isolated environment
- ✅ You can browse, log in, and use the site normally
- ✅ All data (cookies, history, logins) exists only while the browser is open
- ⚠️ When you close Jasmine or the tab, ALL data is permanently deleted
- 🔄 Next time you launch that website, it's completely fresh with no memory of previous visits

**Perfect for:** Testing, temporary access, sensitive browsing, or when you don't want to leave any traces

#### 2. Persistent Multi-Account Management (Private Profile With Saving)
When you launch websites with "Use Private Profile" and save them as sessions:

- ✅ Creates permanent isolated environments for each website/account
- ✅ Login states, cookies, and preferences are saved forever
- ✅ Each private profile maintains its own separate data between browser sessions
- ✅ You can have multiple accounts on the same service, each in its own private profile

**Perfect for:** Managing multiple accounts, work/personal separation, or maintaining different identities online

## 🌟 Real-World Use Cases with Examples

### 📧 Gmail Multi-Account Management
**Scenario:** You have personal Gmail, work Gmail, and side-project Gmail accounts.

**Setup:**
1. Launch Gmail with "Use Private Profile" → Log into personal account (john.doe@gmail.com)
2. Launch Gmail again with "Use Private Profile" → Log into work account (john@company.com)
3. Launch Gmail again with "Use Private Profile" → Log into project account (john@startup.com)
4. Save all three tabs as "All Gmail Accounts" session

**Result:** One-click access to all three Gmail accounts simultaneously, each completely isolated. No conflicts, no accidental cross-posting, no logging out of one to access another.

### 💻 GitHub Development Workflow
**Scenario:** You contribute to personal projects, work repositories, and open-source projects.

**Setup:**
1. Launch GitHub with "Use Private Profile" → Log into personal account with your repositories
2. Launch GitHub with "Use Private Profile" → Log into work organization account
3. Launch GitHub with "Use Private Profile" → Log into open-source contributor account
4. Add related development tools (each with private profiles if needed)
5. Save as "Development Session"

**Result:** Switch between different GitHub identities instantly, each with its own commit history, starred repos, and organization access.

### 📱 Social Media Management
**Scenario:** You manage personal accounts plus business/brand accounts.

**Setup:**
1. Launch Twitter with "Use Private Profile" → Personal account
2. Launch Twitter with "Use Private Profile" → Business account
3. Launch Instagram with "Use Private Profile" → Personal account
4. Launch Instagram with "Use Private Profile" → Business account
5. Launch Facebook with "Use Private Profile" → Personal account

7. Save as "Social Media Management" session

**Result:** Manage all accounts simultaneously without constant logging in/out or browser switching.

### 🛒 E-commerce and Shopping
**Scenario:** You want to compare prices, manage different buyer accounts, or separate personal/business purchases.

**Setup:**
1. Launch Amazon with "Use Private Profile" → Personal account with your wishlist and payment methods
2. Launch Amazon with "Use Private Profile" → Business account for company purchases
3. Launch eBay with "Use Private Profile" → Separate account for selling
4. Launch eBay with "Use Private Profile" → Account for buying collectibles
5. Save as "Shopping Accounts" session

**Result:** Access all your e-commerce accounts simultaneously, each with its own purchase history, saved items, and payment methods.

## 🔄 Mix and Match Strategies

### Hybrid Sessions - Combining Private and Shared Profiles
You can create sessions that mix private profiles (for isolation) with shared profiles (for integration):

**Example "Work Session":**
- **Gmail Work** (private profile) → Isolated work email
- **Google Calendar** (shared profile) → Can access work Gmail for calendar integration
- **Slack** (private profile) → Work team communication, isolated from personal
- **GitHub Work** (private profile) → Work repositories only
- **Stack Overflow** (shared profile) → General development research
- **Company Intranet** (shared profile) → General company resources

This gives you isolation where you need it (email, code, team chat) but integration where it's helpful (calendar seeing email, shared research browsing).

### Testing and Development
- **Production site** (shared profile) → Your normal user account
- **Staging site** (private profile) → Test account #1
- **Development site** (private profile) → Test account #2
- **Admin panel** (private profile) → Administrative access
- **Analytics dashboard** (shared profile) → Can see data from production

### Privacy Levels
- **Banking/Financial** (private profile) → Maximum isolation for sensitive accounts
- **Work accounts** (private profile) → Professional identity separation
- **Personal accounts** (private profile or shared) → Depending on privacy needs
- **General browsing** (shared profile) → Convenience for sites that can share data

## 🚀 Advanced Multi-Account Scenarios

### Freelancer/Consultant Setup
- **Client A project tools** (all private profiles) → Completely isolated work environment
- **Client B project tools** (all private profiles) → Separate isolated environment
- **Personal business tools** (private profiles) → Your own business accounts
- **General research/tools** (shared profile) → Non-sensitive shared resources

### Content Creator Workflow
- **YouTube Channel A** (private profile) → Gaming content channel
- **YouTube Channel B** (private profile) → Educational content channel
- **Twitch streaming** (private profile) → Live streaming account
- **Social media for Channel A** (private profiles) → Gaming community accounts
- **Social media for Channel B** (private profiles) → Educational community accounts
- **Research and inspiration** (shared profile) → General content research

## 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Manager

Jasmine includes a built-in Two-Factor Authentication code generator that helps you manage and generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for your accounts.

### What is 2FA?
Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond just your password. This usually involves a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds.

### Key Features
- Generate 6-digit TOTP codes for any 2FA-enabled account
- Real-time code updates every 30 seconds
- Visual countdown timer showing when codes refresh
- One-click code copying to clipboard
- Secure local storage of account secrets
- Support for multiple accounts from different services

### How to Access
- Open the 2FA Manager from the Toolbar icon or the Tools Menu
- The manager opens in a separate window
- Resizable interface with accounts list and code display

### Adding 2FA Accounts
1. Click "Add Account" button
2. Enter account name (e.g., "GitHub", "Google", "Discord")
3. Paste the secret key from the website's 2FA setup
4. Optionally enter the issuer/company name
5. Click OK to save

### Where to Find Secret Keys
When enabling 2FA on websites, they typically show:
- A QR code for mobile apps
- A text secret key (what you need for Jasmine)
- Look for "Can't scan QR code?" or "Manual entry" options

### Using Generated Codes
- Select an account from the list
- Current 6-digit code displays in large text
- Countdown timer shows seconds until next refresh
- Click "Copy Code to Clipboard" for easy pasting
- Codes automatically update every 30 seconds

### Supported Services
Works with any service that supports TOTP 2FA:
- Google/Gmail accounts
- GitHub
- Discord
- Microsoft accounts
- Banking websites
- Social media platforms
- And many more
